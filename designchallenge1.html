		<h1>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h1>
		<p>I chose the following two sites: <a href="http://www.thisispapershop.com/collections/bags-rucksacks">ThisIsPaper</a> and <a href="http://abbyseymour.com/">Abby Seymour</a></p>
		<p>On the ThisIsPaper site, they have utilized space in a really smart manner. They are clearly selling different types of items and they use the homepage to provide a main focal point at the top so you know what the site is and how you could navigate but then your eye moves to all the options they have highlighted for items on that homepage. It is a really nice way to give some focus while also allowing a nice flow to the rest of the page and incorporating other pages on the site.</p>
		<p>On the Abby Seymour site, I love how clean the design is. The main image, which rotates between a couple of images is very large and clearly pulls focus. There is no negative space. There is a clear logo on the top left and a menu on the top right.</p>
		<h1>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h1>
		<p>When I compared the two, I can actually see some similarities, probably why I chose them. But also saw some subtle differences that I think distinguishes them. They both have very clear logos and menu options at the top of the page. They also both use a lot of space with the images and pull focus in that way. Since these are both consumer sites, they are clearly trying to pull the consumer in a certain way towards the products they make. In the ThisIsPaper site, I really like how they have organized the homepage because you feel like there is a sense of choice in how you navigate the site and you automatically get an idea of the products that they sell. However, I think that the top of the page where the logo and menu are is a little overcrowded. So you get a sense of choice but the design is not as clean. With the Abby Seymour site, I really loved how simple her logo and menu are. They are straight to the point, not too busy, and you get a sense of the products right away without being overwhelmed by visual stimulus. However, the downfall to this is that the main rotating images on the first page are so big that you do not realize you can scroll down to see the products. I think that it would be better if the products were then on its own page. (If you click on Shop, it is the same as the homepage and was confusing to me at first that I could scroll down to see the products but that the pages were identical.) So they both have pros and cons.</p>
		<h1>What makes them similar and different?</h1>
		<p>From the thumbnail layout sketches I reviewed, it seemed to me that the key to making solutions look clear depended heavily on how well they identified different items on the page. Another factor seemed to be how people chose to use space and if they made things to scale. Some of my favorite sketches were not very complex but used clear images and were simple. I could visualize what it would look like on a live site and that not only made it clear to me in understanding their vision, but also in understanding their motivation in the design itself.</p>
		<h1>Thumbnail Sketches</h1>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Web Page Design Overall</strong></li>
			<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/birdiedesigns/birdiedesigns.github.io/master/unit2websiteoutline.png">
			<p>No explanation for this image since this was just a way for me to organize my thoughts.</p>
			<li><strong>Home Page 1</strong></li>
			<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/birdiedesigns/birdiedesigns.github.io/master/unit2home1.png">
			<p>The focal point of this sketch is the main image that will take the whole screen. The hierarchy will be clear and clean. The image is the focus, but it is not an actionable item on the screen. This then lends itself to having the reader choose from the menu items at the top to direct them. The balance of the page again would be pretty simple and clean due to the one image and only a menu to choose from.</p>
			<li><strong>Home Page 2</strong></li>
			<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/birdiedesigns/birdiedesigns.github.io/master/unit2home2.png">
			<p>The focal point on this page is less clear and straight forward. There is a larger picture which commands focus, but then the smaller images down the page and the menu can also compete for attention. The hierarchy then is that the main image would come first and then followed by the additional images below and finally the menu items. The balance of this page would be to showcase the main image but then allow people other options to choose from. While the focus would be of more of a competing nature, there is still a nice balance between the main image and the way the other items would be distributed on the page.</p>
			<li><strong>Shop Page 1</strong></li>
			<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/birdiedesigns/birdiedesigns.github.io/master/unit2shop1.png">
			<p>The focal point here is the main image that would rotate. Then the hierarchy goes from the main image to the different shop category options above the image and description below that. The balance here is well distributed between the text above and below the main image.</p>
			<li><strong>Shop Page 2</strong></li>
			<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/birdiedesigns/birdiedesigns.github.io/master/unit2shop2.png">
			<p>The focal point here is competing with the categories written out and then followed by a series of photos below each one. There is therefore not clear specific focal point or hierarchy (outside of the order it is listed in). Due to the symmetrical nature of the list and its equally distributed images, there is balance to the organization of the page.</p>
			<li><strong>Maker Page 1</strong></li>
			<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/birdiedesigns/birdiedesigns.github.io/master/unit2maker1.png">
			<p>The focal point here is on the larger image on the top left and then the text to the right of it. They are simply the larger items so they command attention. Due to this, they are also the first on the hierarchy of the page, followed by the two lower images. Due to the two columns on the page and how symmetrical the information is laid out, there is a natural balance.</p>
			<li><strong>Maker Page 2</strong></li>
			<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/birdiedesigns/birdiedesigns.github.io/master/unit2maker2.png">
			<p>The focal point on this page is less straight forward. While you have the larger image and text at the top, as in the last page, you also have more images, including a larger one on the bottom. Due to the positioning of the items and their size, the hierarchy would suggest that the reader start with the text and the larger image on the top right and then flow down the page to the other images (with emphasis on the larger image at the bottom due to its size). The balance on this page is not quite as clear, but since the image and text at the top and the image at the bottom will be the same height, there will be a nature fluidity between spaces.</p>
			<li><strong>Gallery Page 1</strong></li>
			<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/birdiedesigns/birdiedesigns.github.io/master/unit2gallery1.png">
			<p>The focal point on this page is the main image that will rotate and then moves down to the smaller images below as a natural hierarchy. The balance on this page is similar to some others where there is little negative space with a focus on images.</p>
			<li><strong>Gallery Page 2</strong></li>
			<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/birdiedesigns/birdiedesigns.github.io/master/unit2gallery2.png">
			<p>The focal point on this page is also the main image that will rotate in the middle of the page. However, since there are some smaller images above it, the hierarchy flows that you would at least scroll through those items before focusing your attention on the larger, rotating image and then to the bottom images. Since the images above and below the main rotating images in the middle will be the same size, there will be a nice symmetrical nature to the pages balance and will have more negative space than most of the other sketches.</p>
			<li><strong>Contact Page 1</strong></li>
			<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/birdiedesigns/birdiedesigns.github.io/master/unit2contact1.png">
			<p>The focal point on this page is the main image and the top title of the page. In terms of hierarchy, you would start with the main image and then move on to the text below it. The balance on this page includes more negative space than I usually like to include, but due to the nature of it, it is nature.</p>
			<li><strong>Contact Page 1</strong></li>
			<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/birdiedesigns/birdiedesigns.github.io/master/unit2contact2.png">
			<p>The focal point on this page takes you to the center images, although you would probably skim the three text columns first. Therefore, with hierarchy, you would first focus on the three images and then the larger image at the bottom to then return to the text at the top for the actual information you may be looking for. Again, due to the nature of a Contact page, there is more negative space here, but there is also a clear symmetry with the three columns and then larger image at the bottom that takes up the full area.</p>
